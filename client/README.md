# Frontend

## Usage

First, we have to install the application & run the Vite frontend development environment.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # runs the frontend
```

Launch another terminal and run the `json-server` mock database for frontend development purposes.

```bash
npm run server:mock    # runs the mock db
```
